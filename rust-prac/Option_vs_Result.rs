/*
 * Purpose:

=> Option<T> emphasizes the absence or presence of a value.
=> Result<T, E> focuses on success (with a value) or failure (with an error).

Error Handling:

=> None in Option<T> doesn't necessarily represent an error. It might mean the value wasn't found.
=> Err(error) in Result<T, E> explicitly captures a specific error that occurred.

Choosing Between Option<T> and Result<T, E>:

=> Use Option<T> when dealing with the potential absence of a value without associated errors.
=> Use Result<T, E> when handling operations that might succeed with a value or fail with a specific error type.
